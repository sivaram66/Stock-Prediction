# Stock Market Prediction

This Django-based web application predicts stock prices using an LSTM model. Users can register, log in, and analyze stock market trends by selecting a stock ticker. The application uses historical stock data for prediction.

## Features

1. **User Registration & Login**  
   Users can register and log in to access the dashboard. OTP verification is used for secure registration.

2. **Stock Price Prediction**  
   Once logged in, users can select a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT), and the model predicts the next stock price based on the last 100 data points.

3. **Prediction Accuracy**  
   The model calculates the prediction accuracy by comparing the predicted price to the latest actual stock price.

4. **Chances Limitation**  
   Non-superuser accounts have limited chances to make predictions per day. If chances run out, users will be informed.

5. **Superuser Functionality**  
   Superusers are not limited by chances and can access all features without restrictions.

6. **Stock Data Visualization**  
   The application provides visual analysis of stock data, plotting actual vs. predicted prices.

## Workflow

1. **Register**  
   - Users provide their name, username, email, and password.
   - An OTP is sent to the provided email for validation.

2. **Login**  
   - Users log in with their username/email and password.

3. **Dashboard**  
   - Users select a stock ticker to make predictions.
   - The prediction model returns the predicted next price and the predicted future price for the selected stock.

4. **Analysis**  
   - Visual representation of actual vs. predicted stock prices is shown on the analysis page.

5. **Logout**  
   - Users can log out at any time.

## Model Overview

The prediction model uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network trained on historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance library). The model processes the last 100 days of stock prices to predict future values.

## Endpoints

1. **`/register/`**  
   - User registration form.
  
2. **`/login/`**  
   - User login page.

3. **`/dashboard/`**  
   - Main dashboard where users can select a stock ticker for prediction.

4. **`/analysis/`**  
   - A page for analyzing predicted stock prices against actual prices with visual plots.

5. **`/logout/`**  
   - Logs the user out of the application.
